# Final-Year-Software-Development-Project
This project is a representation of a infrastructural system that could be implemented as an alternative to the current "Remote Keyless Ignition" method of starting vehicles. 
This project consisted of 4 separate applications that were connected via a central, locally-hosted MySQL Server.
