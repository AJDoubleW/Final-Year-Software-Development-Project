# Final-Year-Software-Development-Project
This project is a representation of a infrastructural system that could be implemented as an alternative to the current "Remote Keyless Ignition" method of starting vehicles. 
This project consisted of 4 separate applications: the "main" file of each application is followed by the rest of the source code for that application.
